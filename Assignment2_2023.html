        <p>Following the success of the initial website launch, the <i>Learning Ladder</i> group have decided to expand the site to faciliate listing games submitted by teachers all over the world.
           To this end your project is now to extend your website to allow people to complete a form listing their game ideas with all the details required by <em>Learning Ladder.</em>
        </p>
        <p>The site staff do not want a website with a sterile, professional look about it, but would prefer a simple, friendly and attractive website.</p>
        <p>Your task now is to build a friendly, welcoming website with functionality for data collection of the nature of the <em>game categories</em> of Assignment 1. In the interest of transparency, the information is to be displayed on the web page in such a way that it matches the website theme.
        </p>		
        <p>
          Your assignment will have the following parts.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><a href="#server">Web server Setup</a></li>

        <p>
          All pages must have good readability, consistency and navigation. Details of all of these pages are given below.
        </p>

        <hr />

		<h2 id="all"> General guidelines for preparing your all web pages </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>All pages will be coded according to the HTML Living Standard.</li>
			<li>All pages will contain the full HTML document structure, including &lt;&#33;DOCTYPE&gt;, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;title&gt; and &lt;body&gt;</li>
			<li>All pages will use Cascading Style Sheets for visual formatting. You must use an external style file (style.css) 
				which will define the style for all web pages you have created, as well as a few (NOT many) inline styles.
				<ul>
				    <li>All visual formatting of the Web site will be implemented using
						<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">Cascading Style Sheets</a>.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Use an external CSS for all web pages. You may use more than one if you wish.</strong></li>
					<li>Use at least one <em>id</em> and  one <em>class</em> selector.</li>
					<li>At least one &lt;div&gt;, used to provide some interesting styling (your choice of borders, background, floating alignment, etc.)</li>
					<li>At least one &lt;span&gt;, used to provide some formatting (e.g. a colour or font change) for a few words of text</li>
					<li>Use a document-level style sheet to apply styles that
						are unique to the particular page (if appropriate).
					</li>
					<li>Only use inline styles for one-off visual effects.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
        
			<li>You must store image files in the appropriate locations of the website, using the <em>data/uploads</em> folder for content images (such as game images), and <em>theme/&lt;yourname>/images</em> folder for theme-based images (such as page backgrounds).</li>
			<li>A nice background for the whole web site is required. The text must be readable with the background.</li>
			<li>A left side margin of at least 1 cm for the main content of all pages will be used.</li>
			<li>Use hyperlinks on each of the pages that provide navigation capabilities for your site.
				<ul>
					<li>Hyperlinks from the Index page to other pages. Also hyperlinks from other pages back to the Index page. These links should use <em>a relative</em> URL.</li>
					<li>Each page should also have links to every other page. </li>
					<li>The text colours of a link before they are visited, after they are visited and during a user action must be different from each other. The link must appear noticeably bigger when you move the cursor over them.</li>
				</ul></li>
        <li>The footer of each page should contain a copyright statement including your name, student number, email address, and degree.</li>
			<li>The pages must have good readability, consistency and navigation.</li>
			<li>All code files must include comments for your code, including comments at the top of the file, stating the name of the file, 
			the name of the author and the date the file was created.
			</li>
      <li>You are not permitted to use third-party libraries, themes, or frameworks (such as Bootstrap), or CSS (aside from the reset CSS linked below).</li>

      <strong>MILESTONE 1:<br>All of the tasks in this section will be checked by your demonstrator in the week 8 lab - 1%</strong>
        <h2 id="server">Web server Setup</h2>       

        <p>
          Your website must run on an <em>Apache</em> web server, using <em>GetSimple CMS</em> to organise the site files and <em>PHP 8.2</em> to implement the server-side behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>The recommended way to do this is to install <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/files/WampServer%203/WampServer%203.0.0/wampserver3.3.0_x64.exe/download">WampServer</a> on your computer. Create a virtual host to serve your website content and use the tray icon to change the version of PHP from the version 7.4.33 default to version 8.2.0. Download GetSimple CMS from Canvas (either from the assignment 2 folder, or the week 9 lab folder) and <a href="http://get-simple.info/wiki/quick_install">install it in the document root of your virtual host</a>. Make sure you are using the version of GetSimple CMS from Canvas, NOT the official website (the official version is not fully compatible with PHP 8).</p>

        <p>Once you have installed GetSimple CMS, you must import your website from Assignment 1. The steps to do this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the admin panel of GetSimple, and create each page, copying in the source HTML code into the editor.</li>
<li>Move any content-based images (such as product pictures) into the <em>data/uploads</em> folder. Change the image <em>src</em> attributes in the HTML to point to the new location.</li>
<li>Create a sub-directory in the <em>data/pages</em> folder named <em>games</em>. Move your XML files (the template.xml file and the two game category XML files) into this folder.</li>
<li>Create a new folder in the <em>themes</em> directory. Give it any name you wish (as a default, you can use your own name). Copy your external stylesheet <em>style.css</em> into this new folder. Inside the folder, create a sub-directory called <em>images</em> and move any visual images (such as background images) into it. Update any image paths in your external stylesheet to point to the new location.</li>
<li>In your theme folder <em>theme/yourname</em> create a file called <em>template.php</em>. In this file, create a template that links to the external stylesheet, and calls the appropriate methods to get the page data.</li>
<li>Once again in the admin panel of GetSimple, select the <em>Theme</em> tab and change the theme from the default to the one you created.</li>
</ul>

<p>You might find it useful to create partial PHP templates for different components of your website, such as the navigation bar, header, footer, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Note: All files in the folders (theme, data/pages, and data/uploads) must be your own work. You are not permitted to use any third-party plugins or themes for GetSimple CMS, including any that came pre-installed. While you may look at these files for reference, you cannot copy the code, this will be considered plagiarism.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<hr />
</div>

<h2 id="style">Website design</h2>	

<p>The site staff want the website to be well-designed, and easily accessible for both humans and computers (especially search engines). To that end, the website must look visually appealing across a wide range of devices, and use a consistent style independent of which web browser is used.</p>

<p>To achieve this, all webpages must link a CSS reset file <em>reset.css</em> as the first set of CSS rules to be processed. Download a copy of Eric Meyer's CSS reset <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css">here</a>, and place it in your theme folder along with your own external CSS file. Update the template.php file to link this before your own <em>style.css</em>. You will need to update your <em>style.css</em> to specify styles that were removed by the CSS reset.</p>

<p>All webpages should use a responsive layout, that grows and shrinks when the screen size changes. The website should also use a different layout for small screens (and specifically mobile devices) and you must achieve this by using media queries in your <em>style.css</em>. You should set the <em>viewport</em> meta tag in your template file to indicate that your webpages are mobile-friendly.</em></p>

<p>Finally, you must optimise your website. This means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Optimising images such that overly large files are not unnecessarily loaded for small display sizes. All images should be in a compressed, efficient format such as webp or avif. You can use <a href="https://squoosh.app/">an image compression service</a> to optimise your images. All images must include a descriptive <em>alt</em> attribute that describes the image for screen readers.
  </li>
  <li>Minimizing content layout shift by setting explicit widths and heights for images.</li>
  <li>Minimizing page load times by reducing the amount of content the browser needs to download in order to initially display the page. As your <em>style.css</em> file grows, you might find it more efficient to use multiple external CSS files, to split the styles that need to be loaded immediately, vs the styles that won't be needed until the user interacts with the page in some way. You might also consider using media queries in the link tags to further split the external CSS for desktop vs mobile layouts.</li>
  <li>Adding appropriate information for search engines, such as optimising page titles, level 1 headers, and setting a <em>description</em> meta tag (which can be done in the GetSimple CMS admin panel under Page Options).</li>
  <li>To check whether your website meets the requirements, use the Lighthouse tool in either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge to inspect your website. Check both desktop and mobile devices under the categories: performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO (you can deselect progressive web app tests). Aim to score 100% in all categories (except for the HTTPS check under Best Practices which can be ignored). If the website is loading slower than you expect, try disabling extensions (you can use a command line flag to do this e.g. "chrome.exe --disable-extensions". This will be done when marking.</li>
</ul>

        <div id="MilestoneTwo">
          <strong>MILESTONE 2:<br>Some of the tasks in this section will be checked by your demonstrator in the week 10 lab - 1%<br>To complete this milestone you must show the following:<br><ul><li>At least one of the marked JavaScript tasks in this section must be completed (Any task marked in yellow can be used for this)</li><li>Both of your game category pages loaded from a PHP template with all data from the XML files (this does not have to be sorted or even look good at this point, but all data must be displayed, including images and links in their correct elements)</li></ul></strong>

        <h2 id="form">Data Collection Page</h2>

        <p>
          As we already know, the site staff want a form for <em>Data Collection</em> where a teacher can list their own games and activities for others to use.</p>
  <p>
          This page will allow website visitors (users) to provide details about their games. This
          will be done as a form, which sends the information as a POST request to a script <em>submit.php</em> located in the document root of your website when they
          click the "Submit" button. The following things need to be included on the page.

  </p>

        <ol>
          <li>An appropriate level 1 heading.</li>


          <li>Information about the person submitting
             <ul>
               <li> Their name (use 1 or 2 text fields here - your choice)</li>
               <li> Their email address.</li>
               <li> How many games they have previously submitted.</li>
               <li> A binary choice question such as whether or not they have taught in the past 5 years 
               (not necessarily this - feel free to make up your own question). Apply a default response here. </li>
             </ul> 
             </li> 

          <li>Information about the game/activity - Include <em>all</em> information in your XML template, with the following additional requirements:
		<ul>
	    <li>Required tags and attributes (elements with no modifiers or the '+' modifier, and attributes with #REQUIRED) should be required fields on your form before it can be submitted. These fields should be visually marked to the user with an asterisk '*'.</li>
          <li>A dropdown box for the user to indicate the category of the game. The dropdown box should list all existing categories, and an option for the user to create a new category (you will need to use PHP to get the existing categories if doing the bonus task below).</li>
          <li>A checkbox to indicate whether the user has read the terms and conditions. This checkbox should be required before the form can be submitted.</li>
          <li class="JSTask">There should be buttons to add required equipment for each game as per the XML. Each individual item should also have a button to delete it (there is a minimum of one, so the delete button of the last remaining item should be removed). Use JavaScript to implement the behaviour of these buttons.</li>
          <li class="JSTask">If any reviews are entered, each review must somewhere contain the phrase &quot;x out of 5 stars&quot; (where x must be a number from 0 to 5 allowing a single decimal place [so 0, 1.1, 3, and 4.5 are all valid]). Use JavaScript to check this when the submit button is clicked, the form should not submit if this phrase is not present in <strong>each</strong> review, and an error message should be displayed to the user. Remember, there could be zero reviews.</li>
          <li class="JSTask">When the user enters or changes any cost (game cost or additional cost of equipment) field, separate read-only fields should display the total cost of the game including all equipment as well as the corresponding price category of the game. If the total is $0, the category should be 'Free', otherwise if the total is less than $25 the category should be 'Cheap', games with a total cost above $100 are considered 'Expensive', and any other game is 'Affordable'. The total cannot be allowed to be negative when the form is submitted. Use JavaScript to calculate and update these fields.</li>
          <li>Buttons to submit and clear the form should be present.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ol>
	
	<p>Each field should use an appropriate input type that is intuitive to the user and minimizes the chance of an invalid input being entered.</p>

        <hr />

 	  <h2 id="data">Category Pages</h2>

        <p>
          You will be writing a separate PHP template to process your XML game category pages from Assignment 1 into HTML. The HTML that is generated should fit in with the style of the rest of your website (ie similar formatting, colors, etc). You will need to use CSS in your generated HTML as with the rest of your website.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that all your XML game pages have the same tags and DTD and therefore they can all use the same PHP template. This means you will only make 1 PHP file, which will have the following:
  </p>

        <ul>
          <li>A level 1 heading which mentions the category you used for your game pages in Assignment 1 (e.g., sports, icebreakers, tabletop, video games, etc)</li>
          <li>List of all the games in the category, sorted alphabetically by name and including the following:
            <ul>
              <li>The game description</li> 
              <li>Link to the website related to the game.</li>
              <li>Any image(s) of the game listed in the XML file.</li>
              <li>All extra data that you stored for each game, such as cost, search tags, etc</li>
              <li>All this data must be collected from the XML game pages.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Any and all other information that is in your XML files.</li>
          
        </ul>

        <p>Your PHP template should read the category of the page to load from the GET parameters of the page. For example, to load the sports page, the URL would be, for example: http://learningladder/games?category=sports</p>
        <p>You will place your PHP template in your theme folder, with your <em>template.php</em>, <em>style.css</em> and other theme files. Give it a different name.</p>

        <p>Create an empty page in the GetSimple admin panel called <em>games</em>, under Page Options, select your newly created Page Template.</p>
        <p>You will need to update the navigation links on your website to load the correct page for each category. Remember, all links to game category pages will link to the same page, the only difference should be the query string <em>?category=</em> at the end of the link.</p>

        <p class="JSTask">Finally, you should add JavaScript to the category pages, to store the name of the category page viewed, along with the date and time it was viewed in a cookie on the user's browser. Add JavaScript to the homepage to remind a returning user of the game category they were last viewing, along with the date and time they viewed it, reading the stored cookie to obtain this information.</p>

        <hr />
        </div>

        <h2 id="visual">Visual Formatting</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>All visual formatting of the Web site will be implemented
            using
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/">Cascading Style Sheets</a>.
          </li>
          <li>All documents will share a common external style sheet (potentially multiple, split for different devices as described above).
            <ul>
              <li>You will use classes to apply styles to common types of
                content.</li>
              <li>For example, the copyright notice at the bottom of each page
                could be in a division with <code>class="copyright"</code>
                  with a common style defined in the external style sheet.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Use a document-level style sheet to apply styles that
            are unique to the particular page (if appropriate).
          </li>
          <li>Use inline styles only for one-off visual effects.
            <ul>
              <li>Before doing so, you should consider whether the effect
                might be reused in the future on other tags in the page or
                in other pages - if the answer is yes, place
                it in the document-level or external style sheets.</li>
              <li>Even if the visual effect is a one-off, you should still use
                the <code>class</code> attribute to indicate the semantic
                reason for the visual formatting.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

	<h2 id="design">Web Design</h2>
<p>A successful website must meet clearly identified goals and provide compelling content that draws target audience to the site. In addition it should be easy to navigate and feature visual attractiveness.</p>
<p>When designing a good website, consider things like navigability, content layout, element positioning on screen, text size, colour contrast, consistency, and accessibility.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="style">Coding Style</h2>
<p>Your HTML code, XML code, CSS code, JavaScript, and PHP code must be neat, clear, indented, and commented.</p>
<p>Other than the specifications mentioned, the way you design your page is up to you. However it should use semantically-correct tags. All of your work (HTML, XML, CSS, XSLT, and Javascript) should be validated and valid (meaning no errors <strong>or warnings</strong>). Any HTML pages generated by PHP must validate.</p>

        <h3>Additional task for SENG6051 students <span style="color: darkorchid">(Bonus marks for SENG1050 students)</span></h3>

        <p><strong>Submitting the form:</strong></p>
        <p>You will write a PHP script <em>submit.php</em> to receive and process the form for new games.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The client can always bypass client-side JavaScript to submit invalid data (remember, zero-trust for client operations). For this reason, you must validate that the submitted form data complies with all of the above requirements.</li>
          <li>If the submitted data is invalid, the script should return the user to the form page and display an error message indicating what the problem was.</li>
          <li>If the data is valid, the script should check if the user is creating a new category or using an existing one. For a new category, the script should create a copy of your <em>template.xml</em> file, and name the copy after the new category <em>(e.g. aigames.xml)</em>.</li>
          <li>Once the script has confirmed that the required category file exists (either by creating it, or referencing an existing one), the XML file should be opened, and the new product data should be added. The resulting XML file MUST be valid (that is, it must validate).</li>

        <h3 id="research">SENG6051 only - Research Task</h3>
		<p>Consider the following thesis statement:</p>
		<p><em>The peer-to-peer model is impossible to make secure, because trusted operations may be performed by malicious peers, communication confidentiality can never be guaranteed, and private keys used in asymmetric encryption are easier to steal.</em></p>
		<p>Write a short essay of 2000 words (± 200 words and not counting front-matter or end-matter) critically evaluating the above statement. Your essay should present the arguments for both sides of the statement, should reference current research in the field, and reach a conclusion on whether the statement is valid or not.
		</p>
		<p>Your essay should be properly formatted, including an introduction, conclusion, and references (use IEEE referencing style).</p>
		<p>In addition to the above, your essay will be marked on the depth of your research, your analysis of the literature, and how well you have understood the topic and evaluated the thesis statement.</p>

          In the GetSimple CMS admin panel, navigate to Backups -> Website Archives, and select Create New Archive Now. You will find the created zip file in <em>backups/zip</em> This zip should contain all the files that contribute to
          the Web site, including HTML, CSS, XML, PHP and image files. This consists, at a minimum of the entire content of the <em>data</em> and <em>theme</em> directories.
          You must also include a <span class="file">README.txt</span> file,
          containing your student number, list of the files that are part
          of your submission, and the original sources of any data, images, etc taken from other places.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, your submission should include a completed
          Assignment Cover Sheet. You should download a
          cover sheet template,
          then fill in the details and include it with your submission.
          <em>Note:</em> an Assignment Cover Sheet submitted electronically is deemed to
          have been signed.
          Your assignment <strong>cannot</strong> be marked until a completed cover sheet
          is received. Both the <span class="file">README.txt</span> and assignment cover sheet should be added to the <em>zip</em> archive, which should be re-named A2_c1234567.zip (replace 1234567 with your student number).

          <h3 id="plagiarism">Warning - Plagiarism</h3>

          <p>
            Plagiarism is defined as
            <dfn>presenting the work of others' as if it were your own</dfn>.
            This includes the copying of content, including images, from other people's
            Web pages (and other sources) without "appropriate referencing"
            (indicating the parts of your assignment which have been
            copied and where they were copied from).
          </p>

          <p>
            If you "quote" or use other people's work in your assignments, then
            you <strong>must</strong> reference them appropriately. If you fail to do 
            so you will be reported to the School's Student Academic Conduct Officer (SACO) 
            for suspicion of plagiarism. An assignment that consists largely of work copied 
            from elsewhere and referenced appropriately will receive very low (zero) marks.  
          </p>

          <p>The use of generative AI (such as ChatGPT) is forbidden for the writing of any code
             or for the research task. Generative AI may be used for purely creative aspects of the
              website (such as coming up with games, descriptions, welcome text, and images) as long 
              as such content is clearly marked. AI detection tools will check each file, and any content 
              with a sufficiently high detection score will be reported to the School for suspicion of plagiarism.
